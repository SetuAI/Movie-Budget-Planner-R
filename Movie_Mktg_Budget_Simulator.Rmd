## Strategic Challenge : Optimizing Movie Marketing ROI 

Sarah Richardson, newly appointed Head of Strategic Marketing at Paramount Pictures, faces a critical Q4 initiative - maximizing ROI on a mid-budget thriller 'Market Makers' ($35M production cost) in an increasingly competitive theatrical landscape. With streaming platforms eroding traditional audience segments and rising CPM rates across digital channels, Richardson must optimize her $12M marketing allocation to deliver against aggressive KPIs:

20% ROI on opening weekend
Minimum 2,500 screens secured for initial release
Sub-$5 customer acquisition cost across marketing channels
15% market share in the key 25-34 demographic

Leveraging the Marketing Budget Simulator's predictive analytics capabilities, Richardson implements a data-driven approach to:

Model revenue decay patterns across competitive release windows
Optimize channel mix between traditional media (declining but stable 30% week-over-week retention) versus digital platforms (higher CPM but enhanced targeting)
A/B test budget allocation scenarios between influencer marketing (strong engagement but uncertain conversion) versus proven PR channels
Project screen count elasticity based on first-weekend performance metrics

With theater chains demanding minimum marketing commitments and studio executives scrutinizing every dollar of marketing spend, the simulator enables Richardson to defend her strategic decisions with quantifiable projections and industry-standard metrics.

## Technical Implementation with LLM Assitance.

Sarah is a tech-inclined marketing professional. She prefers having a predictive analytical tool for marketing budget simulation. Though she lacks coding expertise to build this tool ground up, she is adept on working with LLMs and hence she prefers Claude to build an R shiny application for the use case. Below is the meta prompt she inputs to Claude.

```{r prompt_image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('prompt_sarah.jpg')
```

## Sarah has now implemented the R code and this is how the final output looks like :

```{r simulator_first_image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('simulator_op1.jpg')
```

```{r simulator_second_image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('simulator_op2.jpg')
```

```{r simulator_third_image, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('simulator_op3.jpg')
```

#### Now imagine yourself as a newly appointed as a Strategic Marketing Professional With no to minimal coding ability at your disposal, you too can leverage the intelligence of LLMs to build applications ground up. Now taking inspiration from Sarah's Claude, why don't you try building a "Movie Marketing Budget Simulator using LLM" using R shiny. 



## Once you execute the prompt, copy paste it either on R studio downloaded locally or on posit cloud. Some snippets of the code : 

```{r code_rstudio, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('code_rstudio.jpg')
```

```{r code_rstudio1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('code_rstudio1.jpg')
```

```{r code_rstudio2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('code_rstudio2.jpg')
```

```{r code_rstudio3, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('code_rstudio3.jpg')
```

```{r code_rstudio4, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('code_rstudio4.jpg')

knitr::include_graphics('budgetcalc_code.jpg')
```

```{r budgetcalc_1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('budgetcalc_1.jpg')
```

5 key points explaining the Budget Calculation server logic:

Reactive Data Structure

Creates reactive data frame that updates automatically with user inputs
Maintains five standard marketing categories
Links UI inputs directly to budget calculations
Ensures real-time responsiveness to user changes


Budget Calculation Logic
CopyAmount = category * total_marketing_budget / 100

Converts percentage inputs to dollar amounts
Example: If total budget is $500,000 and digital marketing is 30%
Calculation: $500,000 * 30/100 = $150,000 for digital marketing


Data Organization:

Creates three-column structure:
Category (marketing channels)
Percentage (user input values)
Amount (calculated dollar values)


Enables both percentage and absolute value tracking


Visualization Integration:
Uses plotly to create interactive pie chart
Maps Categories to labels
Maps calculated Amounts to values
Automatically updates with data changes

```

```{r revproj_code1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('revproj_code1.jpg')
```

```{r revproj_code2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('revproj_code2.jpg')
```

```{r KPI1, echo=FALSE, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics('kpi1.jpg')
```


1.Revenue Decay Model:
base_revenue <- input$target_weekend1
decay_rate <- 0.7  # 30% weekly decay
projected_revenue <- base_revenue * decay_rate^(weeks-1)

Calculation Example:

-If opening weekend (base_revenue) = $100,000
-Week 1: $100,000 * 0.7^(1-1) = $100,000 (no decay)
-Week 2: $100,000 * 0.7^1 = $70,000 (30% drop)
-Week 3: $100,000 * 0.7^2 = $49,000 (another 30% drop)


2.Screen Count Modeling

Screens = c(input$screens_week1,  
            input$screens_week2,  
            rep(input$screens_week2 * 0.8, 6))
            
Screen Distribution Logic:
-Week 1: Maximum screens (e.g., 1000)
-Week 2: First drop (e.g., 800)
-Weeks 3-8: Stabilized at 80% of Week 2 (e.g., 640)


3.Visualization Integration
output$revenue_projection_chart <- renderPlotly({
  plot_ly(revenue_projection(), x = ~Week) %>%
    add_lines(y = ~Revenue, name = "Projected Revenue") %>%
    add_bars(y = ~Screens, name = "Screen Count", yaxis = "y2")
    
-Combines revenue line chart with screen count bar chart
-Dual y-axis for comparing trends
-Interactive hover details

4.KPI Calculations

- Marketing Cost per Screen:
Measures efficiency of marketing spend per theater screen
Calculation: Total Marketing Budget ÷ Week 1 Screen Count
Example: $500,000 marketing budget ÷ 1000 screens = $500 per screen
Helps assess marketing efficiency in theater acquisition


- Expected First Weekend ROI:
Measures return on marketing investment for opening weekend
Calculation: ((Target Weekend Revenue ÷ Marketing Budget) - 1) × 100
Example: 
If target is $600,000 and marketing budget is $500,000
($600,000 ÷ $500,000) - 1 = 0.2
0.2 × 100 = 20% ROI

Negative values indicate potential losses

- Marketing Budget % of Production Budget:
Shows marketing spend as percentage of production cost
Calculation: (Marketing Budget ÷ Production Budget) × 100
Example: $500,000 marketing ÷ $5,000,000 production = 10%
Industry benchmark: typically 25-50% for major releases


- Expected Total Revenue:
Sums up projected revenue across all 8 weeks
Accounts for weekly decay rate (30% drop)
Example: Week 1: $100K + Week 2: $70K + Week 3: $49K + ...
Used for overall profitability assessment


- Marketing Cost per Expected Viewer:
Measures customer acquisition cost
Calculation: Marketing Budget ÷ (Total Revenue ÷ Ticket Price)

Example: 
If total revenue is $1M and ticket price is $10:
Expected viewers = $1,000,000 ÷ $10 = 100,000 viewers
Marketing cost per viewer = $500,000 ÷ 100,000 = $5 per viewer
Critical for assessing marketing efficiency
